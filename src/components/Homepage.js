            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              DormiFind started as a student-led initiative aiming to make dorm-hunting less
              stressful and more secure. Inspired by the challenges many students face,
              our team envisioned a platform that brings both convenience and trust to
              the student housing experience. This project reflects our passion for
              problem-solving through technology.
